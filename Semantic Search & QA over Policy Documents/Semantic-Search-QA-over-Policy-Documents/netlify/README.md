# 🚀 **Netlify Deployment Guide - FIXED VERSION**

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: You're Deploying the Wrong Repository!**

### **❌ The Problem:**
Netlify is trying to build a **React/TypeScript project** instead of our **static HTML site**.
This happens when you deploy the main repository instead of the `netlify` folder.

### **✅ The Solution:**
Deploy ONLY the `netlify` folder contents, not the main repository!

## 🌐 **How to Deploy CORRECTLY:**

### **Option 1: Drag & Drop (RECOMMENDED)**
1. **Go to:** [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. **Sign up/Login** with GitHub
3. **Drag the ENTIRE `netlify` folder** to the deploy area
4. **Wait for deployment** (should work now!)
5. **Get your public URL!** 🎉

### **Option 2: Create New Repository**
1. **Create a NEW GitHub repository** (e.g., `pdf-search-netlify`)
2. **Copy ONLY the `netlify` folder contents** to this new repo
3. **Connect Netlify to this NEW repo**
4. **Deploy!**

### **Option 3: GitHub Integration (Current Repo)**
1. **Push the `netlify` folder to your current repo**
2. **In Netlify dashboard, set:**
   - **Build command:** `(leave EMPTY)`
   - **Publish directory:** `netlify`
   - **Base directory:** `netlify`
3. **Deploy!**

## 🔧 **Build Settings in Netlify Dashboard:**
**CRITICAL:** Make sure these are set correctly:
- **Build command:** `(leave empty)` ← **MOST IMPORTANT**
- **Publish directory:** `netlify` (or `.` if using Option 1)
- **Base directory:** `netlify` (if deploying from main repo)

## 📁 **Files That Should Be Deployed:**
✅ `index.html` - Main website
✅ `app.js` - JavaScript functionality  
✅ `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
✅ `package.json` - Prevents build errors
✅ `.nvmrc` - Node version
✅ `README.md` - This file

## 🚨 **Files That Should NOT Be Deployed:**
❌ `src/App.tsx` - React component (wrong project!)
❌ `vite.config.js` - Vite config (wrong project!)
❌ `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript config (wrong project!)
❌ Main repository with Python backend

## 🎯 **What Happens When Deployed Correctly:**
1. **No build command** will be executed
2. **Static HTML files** will be served directly
3. **Your website** will work perfectly!
4. **No more TypeScript/React errors!** 🎉

## 🚨 **If You Still Get Errors:**
1. **Make sure** you're NOT deploying the main repository
2. **Use ONLY the `netlify` folder** contents
3. **Try** the drag & drop method first
4. **Check** that build command is EMPTY

## 🌟 **After Successful Deployment:**
Your website will be at: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

**Share this URL with anyone - it works from anywhere!** 🌍✨

## 🔍 **Why This Happened:**
You probably connected Netlify to your main repository (`Semantic-Search-QA-over-Policy-Documents`) which contains a React/TypeScript project, instead of deploying our static HTML files from the `netlify` folder.
